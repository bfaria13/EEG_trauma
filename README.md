# EEG analysis for Traumatic Brain injury

This repo provide a step-by-step guide line to analyze EEG files to classify patients which got brain trauma from healthy.

### Introduction

> Traumatic brain injury can bring serious consequences for people. Due to the rising number of TBI patients, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging isnâ€™t useful because of their cost and time consumption. On other hand, the brain injury cause electrophysiologic abnormalities visible on electroencephalography (EEG) becoming this technique combined with machine learning approaches stronger helper in diagnostic and prognostic brain injuries. So, the main goal here is applying ML methods to EEG data to predict brain trauma in patients.

### This project expects to generate a full EEG processing pipeline including:

- Raw data preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Exploratory data analysis
- Statistical testing
- Machine learning models development

### Main task:

>	Work on the development of a Machine Learning approach for brain trauma using engineering features and checking the preprocessing quality in data.

### Expected results:

> As the final result, the ML pipeline able to explore significant predictors on the data and provide better-quality metrics for helping to distinguish people suffered from brain trauma in past from healthy controls.
